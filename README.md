# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Throughout the Module, A Board of Elections audit has been completed by using the data provided by the recent local confressional election. The following tasks went over to complete the analysis by using the Python Software.

1. The total number of votes cast calculated.
2. The complete list of candidates who received votes gathered.
3. The total number of votes each candidate received calculated.
4. The percentage of votes each candidate won calculated.
5. The winner of the election determined via popular vote.
In the challenge, the employee has been asked to expand the analysis by implementing each county and its result for the winner candidate. In order to do the task, the employee used the python code provided from the course which has missing parts to figure out.

## Election-Audit Results
As it can be seen in the screenshot of the election_results.txt outcome, 
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
There were total of 369,711 votes in the congressional election. 
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
The counties were:
	- Jefferson
	- Denver
	- Arapahoe
The county results were:
	- Jefferson received 10.5% of the vote and "38855" number of votes.
	- Denver received 82.8% of the vote and "306055" number of votes.
	- Arapahoe received 6.7% of the vote and "24801" number of votes.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
As it can be seen in the screenshot, the county with the largest turnout is Denver.
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
The candidates were:
	- Charles Casper Stockham
	- Diana Degette
	- Raymon Anthony Doanne
The county results were:
	- Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote and "85213" number of votes.
	- Diana Degette received 73.8% of the vote and "272892" number of votes.
	- Raymon Anthony Doanne received 3.1% of the vote and "11606" number of votes.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
As a result of this election, Diana Degette got the 73.8% of the all votes which makes 272892 votes and this result made Diana DeGette the winner.

## Summary
As a summary, Denver is the county that has the largest turnout with 306055 votes which makes the 82.8$ of the total votes. This challange focussed on the election results based on the counties and the candidates. There are many way to expand the implementation of this result and only two of them documented in this document. The manipulations that can be make in order to make the code giving more useful information for the congressional elections:
- The code can be expand by focusing on each county and the candidates vote results in each county, and
- The results may have some formats that will let the comission to see the results more visual by implementing different colors for each candidates, counties, and for the winner.
